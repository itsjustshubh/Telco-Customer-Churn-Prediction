# Telco Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using various machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the company and understand the key factors influencing their decisions.

## Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Deep learning models like Neural Networks, CNN, RNN, and Transformer models.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Model interpretation and feature importance analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which includes customer demographic details, account information, and churn status.

## Requirements
For required libraries, see `requirements.txt`.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/itsjustshubh/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
```

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Navigate to the cloned directory.
2. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python churn_prediction.py
   ```

## Structure
